# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


LIRI can take in one of the following commands:

   * `spotify-this-song`

   * `movie-this`

   * `do-what-it-says`

  Examples of LIRI Node commands:
  1. `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`
  2. `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`
  3. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`
     * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

LIRI, your own personal assistant!
